基础学起,从汇编查看C++的本质

### Content:
---
- [Building Tools][building_tools]
- [Overload function][overload_function]
- [Default parameters][default_parameter]
- [Extern "C"][extern_c]
- [inline][inline]
- [reference][reference]


### Audience
---

It is only a tutorial for *LAYMAN*, but for *FRESHMAN*.
You should have the basic experiences about programming,
heard about the concpets of *OOP*.

!!! Note

    *This is not an all-encompassing guide about C++*.

    I will never introduce all the core concepts, associated knowledge about C++,
    it is such a huge project, I only provide the introduction about core features and some auxiliary library features that frequently used in real world.

    Why I only introduce C++ 11?
    Because the C++ 14/17/20 are not widespreadly used now.
    You can check the [C++ Compiler Support][cpp_compile_support] for more information about the support state of different C++ standards.

!!! Note

    You should prepare some tools for compiling the samples,
    the tools what I used for this serial are list in appendixes.

!!! Note

    Some samples maybe dependent on the 3rd-party library(gtest), I have included it in the code package.
    So I can shou the features clearly.
