Every morning, when I go to school, I always see some people wearing in orange color and sweeping the street. They are the city cleaners. People describe them as the city's decorators. They are easy to be ignored by the public, because they work in the early morning, when most people are sleeping at home. Thanks to them, the public environment is so clean, which brings people great comfort. City cleaners deserve our great respect, so some people will buy them drink in the hot weather. The news reported the moving information about how people show respect to these lovely persons. We are happy to see the public's attention on small people.
